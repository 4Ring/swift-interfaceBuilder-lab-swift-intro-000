> In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Feel comfortable with working with the various aspects of Interface Builder.

## What the student can do at this point 

* Has a general overview of Xcode and is able to create a new project.
* Knows where to locate the testing file within Xcode.
* Knows how to navigate to Interface Builder.
* Knows what a storyboard file is.
* Has a brief overview of what the Object Library is.
* Can drag a View Controller onto the canvas.
* Can locate and drag items from the Object Library.
* Can locate the Attributes Inspector and change the Background color of Views

## Outline / Notes

*  Structure this **lab** with a list of instructions. These instructions should be fairly vague. Maybe instead of instructions we give them some hints as how to go about tackling this lab.
* I've included screenshots of what it is the student has to re-create in Interface Builder. Show them these screenshots and basically have them re-create it.
* NO Autolayout (I've disabled it in the Xcode project that's included with this repo, so they don't have to worry about it).
